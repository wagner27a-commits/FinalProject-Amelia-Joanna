#### Program Overview
UniTask is a task manager productivity planner designed to make completing assignments more enjoyable by rewarding users with the opportunity to take care of a virtual pet. Inspired by the stressful 10 PM deadlines at NCSSM, UniTasks motivates students, especially those whho struggle with procrastination, by blending productivity with with a pet experience. The target audience is NCSSM students seeking a more positive approach to managing academic and extracurricular deadlines. This is extremely useful, especially since through the JavaFX interface, users can create tasks, complete tasks, earn points, feed their pet, increase its happiness, and maintain a healthy balance between productivity and fun.

#### Feature List
1. Users can add tasks labeled with titles and due dates, and the program automatically sorts them based on how soon they are due.
3. When users complete tasks, they earn points that can be spent in the store to purchase different foods or a scarf for their pet, which can either be a unicorn or a dragon.
4. Feeding the pet with these items increases its happiness level, which users can monitor alongside the pet's image in the interface.
5. Users can also play with the pet periodically to boost its happiness even further. After each feeding, a pop-up appears showing the unicorn or dragon's updated stats along with the number of remaining tasks.

#### Know Bugs / Limitations
If time permits, we will add several additional features to enhance the user experience. These include offering more options like adjusting point rewards based on task difficulty or importance. We may also implement subtasks for more detailed task breakdowns, an undo button for task completion, and animations to bring the unicorn/dragon to life. Additional planned improvements could include adding accessory items in the store beyond the scarf, such as hats, bows, or costumes.
